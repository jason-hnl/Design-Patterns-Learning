# Design-Patterns-Learning
Learning design patterns, and examples using C++


As said in this book, when deal with design patterns, we should do as follows(as I quote):

For Observer Pattern
1. Identify the aspects of our application that vary and separate them from what stays the same;
2. Program to an interface, not an implementation;
3. Favor composition over inheirtance

For Decorator Pattern
1. Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification;
